The code has two algorithm choices,
Algorithm 1:
	This algorithm uses, Intensity values from the HSI model,
	where I = (R+G+B)/3, where R,G,B are normalised and are in the [0-1] range
	Brighter/Day images will have more intensity as compared to the darker/night images
	
Algorithm 2:
	This algorithm uses the percentage of darker pixels,
	Here pixel values in the range (0 to 40) are considered as the darker pixels,
	more the number of darker pixels means the images is of night, and vice-versa for day images
